            <p>
                I had joined The Lab Education Centre Singapore on 6th December 2020 and had graduated from its coder module on 19 February 2023. In that period of 26 months, I had been exposed to Raspberry Pi and Grove Pi for their Basic and Intermediate Level and had been highly trained in various libraries in Python. I would like to thank Mr. Cai Jian Bo Paul and Mr. Albert Goh for being my instructor during this 26 months, and had helped me in learning the programming language.

                I had been chosen by my school to participate in the Wits & Words competition 2022. Although we were out in the first round, it was a first for us, considering we had little to no prior debate training.
